# Blender-pyscript
My Blender program written for Pyscript.

Blender is an language blending program. I have written it in both Javascript and Python. Final form will be in python and executed via Pyscript. 
Pyscript will not run as a file, it must have a server to connect file bs.py to Pyscript.
bs.py is a small scale substitute for Blender, for testing purposes.




Blender is part of Natural Immersion LLC, as the owner I maintain right to use of Blender.
